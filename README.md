Introduction
Individuals with severe disabilities often face significant challenges in verbal communication, limiting their ability to express themselves and interact effectively. Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) systems provide valuable tools for assisting these individuals. This project aims to design and develop a cutting-edge silent speech recognition system that adapts to the unique abilities of each user, particularly focusing on older adults who may have difficulty producing audible speech due to age-related factors or conditions such as stroke or neurodegenerative diseases.

Literature Survey
Our literature survey reviews various studies and approaches related to silent speech recognition, imagined speech, and EEG signal processing. Key references include works by Shunan Zhao, Frank Rudzicz, S. Datta, N. V. Boulgouris, and many others who have explored the intersection of neuroscience, deep learning, and assistive communication technologies.

Component Details
The project involves both hardware and software components. Key hardware components include EEG headsets for capturing brain signals and Arduino for converting these signals into a CSV file. The software components involve advanced signal processing techniques and machine learning algorithms to translate EEG features into recognizable speech patterns.

System Requirements
EEG headset (e.g., Muse, NeuroSky)
Arduino microcontroller
Computer with Python and necessary libraries installed
EEG signal processing software
Machine learning framework (e.g., TensorFlow, PyTorch)
System Analysis and Design
The system is designed to be non-invasive, capturing EEG signals through electrodes placed on the scalp. The recorded signals are processed using advanced signal processing techniques to extract relevant features related to silent speech production. Machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, are then trained to recognize and translate these EEG features into speech patterns.

Software Simulation
Software simulations involve creating and testing models that process EEG signals and perform silent speech recognition. Various algorithms and techniques are evaluated to optimize recognition accuracy and response time, with a focus on real-time implementation and user-friendly interfaces tailored to older adults.

Hardware Design
The hardware design includes the configuration of the EEG headset and the integration with the Arduino microcontroller. The system captures brain signals, processes them in real-time, and sends the data to the computer for further analysis and translation into speech.

Conclusion and Future Work
This project aims to provide a robust and efficient silent speech recognition system that significantly improves the quality of life for elderly individuals with speech impairments. Future work will focus on enhancing the accuracy of the recognition models, expanding the system's capabilities, and conducting extensive user testing to refine the user interface and experience.
